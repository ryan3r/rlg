# Description

Load and save functionality.  An extension to the dungeon generator to support
the binary dungeon format.

# Usage

```
build/dungeon [--load=[FILE]] [--save=[FILE]]
```

The load flag can be given to load an existing dungeon.  The save flag can be
given to save the dungeon that is displayed.  If the load flag is not given a
random dungeon will be generated. The program looks for files in the ~/.rlg327
folder if one does not exist it will be created.  If you want to load a file
outside the .rlg327 directory give it an absolute path.

# New and noteworthy

 * There is a basic vector implementation in src/vector.c and include/vector.h
 * The load and save functions have been added at the end of src/dungeon.c
 * I modified Jeremy's dungeon_t to use a vector_t for the rooms
