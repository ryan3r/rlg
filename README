# Description

Distance maps for mosters.  Generates a map of the dungeon and maps showing 
the distance to any point in the dungeon from the player.  

# Usage

```
build/rlg [--load=[FILE]] [--save=[FILE]] [--player="(y,x)"]
```

The optional player flag can be added to set the position of the player.  If 
the player flag is not specified the player will be randomly placed in a room.

The load flag can be given to load an existing dungeon.  The save flag can be
given to save the dungeon that is displayed.  If the load flag is not given a
random dungeon will be generated. The program looks for files in the ~/.rlg327
folder if one does not exist it will be created.  If you want to load a file
outside the .rlg327 directory give it an absolute path.

# Tests

There are tests that compare the output of build/rlg to the outputs generated
by Jeremy.
