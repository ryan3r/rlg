You find your self in a dungeon with no clue how you got
there. But there's no time to figure it out because the
dungeon is full of monsters.  Start by exploring the
dungeon while avoiding monsters.

Game
==========================================================
Monsters are represented by red letters and numbers.
You are the cyan @ symbol.
The . symbols are rooms and the # symbols are corridors.
Finally the < and > are staircases.

The game is turn based so each player takes a turn.  Be
aware that monsters can move multiple times if they are
faster than you.
